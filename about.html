      <div class="text-div">
        <p>
          Christmastime Celebrations was founded in late 2021, when the COVID
          pandemic had been going on for over a year & people were losing hope.
          We wanted to help bring hope back to the community during the holiday
          season, and therefore we decided to create an online event that you
          can participate in from the comfort of your home.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-header">Our Purpose & Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Christmastime Celebrations is an interactive, online event for
          families to come & participate in. We are using 20% of our ticket
          sales to raise money for doctors & health-based organizations to
          help combat COVID. Our goal is to raise $5,000 by the end of 2022, when
          our next major event will begin.
