        Our Website's Originality
      </p>
      <p>
        Our website was coded by our team, and we did not use any frameworks
        systems, nor any templates. We wrote our website in HTML5, CSS, and
        JavaScript, and used Github, VSCode, and Netlify to store, run, and
        deploy our website.

            Christmastime Celebrations was founded in late 2021, when the COVID
            pandemic had been going on for over a year & people were losing
            hope. We wanted to help bring hope back to the community during the
            holiday season, and therefore we decided to create an online event
            that you can participate in from the comfort of your home.

            Christmastime Celebrations is an interactive, online event for

            organizations to help combat COVID. Our goal is to raise $5,000 by
            the end of 2022, when our next major event will begin.
